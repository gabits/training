"""You have a list of people who'll be assigned to take care of a system.
During the week, the system behaves differently than in the weekends, and
therefore the schedule varies according to each day:

- There'll be at least 4 people in the rotation.

- On weekdays, each person will be assigned an amount of sequenced days
which takes continuity in every working day (mon-fri).

- During the weekends, each day should be filled by a different person.
One person should not take two consecutive days or two consecutive weekends
in the rota.

- The weekend schedule should be aware of the working week schedule, so
each person assigned in the weekend will not be the same one as in the previous
or next day of the rota, e.g. the person assigned to Saturday should not be the
same one assigned on the latest friday neither in the upcoming Sunday.

This program should not consider any holidays or unexpected events initially.
